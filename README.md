# EnvSense-linkitone
A prototype of minimal solution for environment sensing
We want to provide a user-friendly, solid and reliable simple system.
This system can help farm accomplish environmental sensing task.

We are inspired by [LASS（Location Aware Sensing System）](https://github.com/LinkItONEDevGroup/LASS), which is famous open source, non-profit environmental sensing project. Please checkout [offical hackpad](https://lass.hackpad.com/LASS-README-DtZ5T6DXLbu) and [website](http://lass-net.org/)
